## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

<h3 align="center"> In this project, I built the Guessing game by using ruby. The main goal is to put into practice the main concepts of Object Oriented Programming. Particularly, classes and access to their attributes.</h3>

- If you want to play it online, visit [this repl link](https://repl.it/@SafaErden/Guessing-Game) to reach and play my Masterming game online.

<h2>How to start the game?</h2>

1- download this repository

2- unpack it (winrar recommended)

3- copy its address from your download path

4- open your terminal commandline (powershell in my case)

5- write "cd" and put the address of the game folder

6- now, to run the game, type 'ruby play.rb'

7- Have fun!

How to Play it...

1. When you run the game, first enter a minimum size for the game then enter a maximum size for the game. So the computer will guess a number between these numbers that you choose. 

2. Then begin to guess the secret number.

3. If you type a number that is higher or lower than the secret number, you will be informed.

4. If you can find the secret number, you win!
